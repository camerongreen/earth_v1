	<div>
<p>In wilderness is the preservation of the world - Henry David Thoreau</p>
<p>There is a sufficiency in the world for man's need but not for man's greed - Gandhi</p>
<p>The growth of ecological awareness in industrialized countries may be one of the last internal obstacles to the complete hegemony of transnational corporate capitalism - Brian Tokar</p>
<p>
Only when the last tree has been cut down, Only when the last river has been poisoned, Only when the last fish has been caught, Only then will you find that money cannot be eaten - Cree Indian Prophecy
</p>
<p>At some point we must draw a line across the ground of our home and our being, drive a spear into the land and say to the bulldozers, earthmovers, government and corporations, "thus far and no further." If we do not, we shall later feel, instead of pride, the regret of Thoreau, that good but overly bookish man, who wrote, near the end of his life, "If I repent of anything it is likely to be my good behaviour" - Ed Abbey</p>
<p>
When we heal the earth, we heal ourselves - David Orr
</p>
<p>It is said that the darkest hour comes just before dawn. I hope so, since in environmental terms the 20th century has certainly been a long, dark night - Dr Claude Martin</p>
<p>
Suburbia is where the developer bulldozes out the trees, then names the streets after them - Bill Vaughn
</p>
<p>The highest wisdom has but one science, the science of the whole, the science explaining the whole creation and man's place in it - Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p>At least 150,000 anthropogenic or human made chemicals at a total that increases by 2,000 each year end up in the oceans - Kevin Brown, Durham University, England</p>
<p>..put the environmental lobby out of business....There is no greater imperative....If the petroleum industry is to survive, it must render the environmental lobby superfluous, an anachronism - Bob Williams (Advisor to the gas and oil industry)</p>
<p>You must turn the public against environmentalists or you will lose your environmental battle as surely as the U.S. Timber industry has lost theirs - Ron Arnold (Industry Consultant)</p>
<p>If sunbeams were weapons of war, we would have had solar energy long ago. - George Porter</p>
<p>I think that I shall never see, A poem lovely as a tree - Alfred Joyce Kilmer</p>
<p>Population growth is the primary source of environmental damage - Jacques Cousteau</p>
<p>Green politics is not about being far left or far right, but far sighted - David Icke</p>
<p>The big corporations, our clients, are scared shitless of the environmental movement.....They sense that there's a majority out there and that the emotions are all on the other side, if they can be heard. They think the politicians are going to yield up to the emotions. I think the corporations are wrong about that. I think the companies will have to give in only at insignificant levels.  Because the companies are too strong, they're the establishment.  The environmentalists are going to have to be like the mob in the square in Romania before they prevail - Frank Mankiewic (Senior executive at transnational firm, Hill and Knowlton)</p>
<p>Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell - Edward Abbey</p>
<p>Trees are poems that the earth writes upon the sky. We fell them down and turn them into paper that we may record our emptiness - Kahil Gibran</p>
<p>Man has been endowed with reason, with the power to create, so that he can add to what he's been given. But up to now he hasn't been a creator, only a destroyer. Forests keep disappearing, rivers dry up, wild life's become extinct, the climate's ruined and the land grows poorer and uglier every day - Anton Chekhov</p>
<p>That mammals larger than dinosaurs and roamers of the seas for millions of years were threatened with extinction by something as transitory as the sunk costs for a whaling fleet says much about human economics, consumption and technological power - Peter J. Stoett, The Internation Politics of Whaling</p>
<p>The earth does not argue, Is not pathetic, has no arrangements, Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise, Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures, Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out - Walt Whitman</p>
<p>As cruel a weapon as the cave man's club, the chemical barrage has been hurled against the fabric of life - Rachel Carson</p>
<p>He that plants a tree, loves others besides himself - English Proverb</p>
<p>...used declassified Soviet Ministry of Fishing reports to find that one Soviet factory ship had told the International Whaling Commission during the 1960s that it [<i>sic</i>] had killed 152 humpback and 156 blue whales.  In fact the ship had taken 7,207 humpbacks and 1,433 blue whales and illegally killed 717 right whales, a species protected by the whaling commission since the 1930s - Associated Press Article</p>
<p>..in the early 1930s, most people living in cities got around on electric streetcars.  Concerned that this wasn't the kind of environment in which they could sell a lot of buses, General Motors, using a series of front companies, began buying streetcar systems, tearing out the tracks and then selling the new, polluting bus systems back to the cities, usually with contracts that prohibited purchase of "any new equipment using fuel or means of propulsion other than gas."...GM was soon joined by Greyhound, Firestone Tire and Rubber, Standard Oil of California (also called Chevrom) and Mack Trucks.  In 1949, after these companies had destroyed more than 100 streetcar systems in more than 45 cities...GM, Chevron and Firestone were convicted of a criminal conspiracy...They were fined $5000 each and the executives who organised the scheme were fined $1 each. - Mark Zepezauer and Arthur Naiman, Take the Rich Off Welfare</p>
