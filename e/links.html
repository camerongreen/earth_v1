		All three of the links to the left allow you to make an environmental donation simply by clicking.  It can't get much easier to do good than that, what takes you a couple of minutes really makes a difference in peoples lives.  See the other sections links (like the Animals one for Primates and Big Cats) for more click to donate links.

		What can be said about this organization which has not already been said.  Greenpeace is at the fore front of environmental management and has acheived an unprecedented public profile.  One of the more famous moments in their history was the bombing of their ship 'The Rainbow Warrior' by the French Secret service, a sure sign they are doing something right.

With so many species facing annihalation the WWF has been active for many years in seeking their preservation.  They co-operate far more than organizations like Greenpeace with governments and corporations, which is a good or a bad thing, ie they get a lot more money, but speak out less on the need for major institutional reform.  One great way of helping is to <a href="http://passport.panda.org" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false">sign up for a PANDA PASSPORT</a> which will send you alerts when there are worldwide environmental issues that need your support.  Often you just need to click on a link to sign a petition etc, and you earn points for every action which let you download beautiful images, screensavers etc, and none of it costs you anymore than the price of your internet connection.

The mission of our non-profit society is to transform our commercial media culture and direct it towards ecological and social awareness. Our mass media, our business culture constantly urges us to consume more and more, yet we know that our planet cannot survive this onslaught, with regards to pollution, biodiversity, resource depletion and climate change. This consumption machine, image making factory is what we want to bring to a grinding halt. We want to create a new media culture that has the human condition rather than commercialism as its heart and soul.

		Probably most famous as the maker of thought provoking documentaries, David Suzuki is an environmentalist second to none.  This is the home page of the organization he has set up to oversee his many and varied concerns.  Well worth a visit.  He does have some strange ideas about us all reverting back to a hunting state, which I guess is achievable if nine tenths of the worlds population dissappears, however if we want change now, I think avoiding simply animal products is the more rational way to go.

		Since 1976 The Wilderness Society and supporters have saved millions of hectares of magnificent wild country and the habitat of many endangered species. Numerous National Parks have been created or expanded and Wold Heritage Areas legislated or nominated as a result of our...campaigning.

The Society is also involved with the enforcement of international laws, regulations and treaties when there is no enforcement by national governments or international regulatory organizations due to absence of jurisdiction or lack of political will. (These guys buy ships and go and ram illegal whalers and fishers, saw a pretty amazing documentary on it)
