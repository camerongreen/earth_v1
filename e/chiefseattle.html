	Chief Seattle

	<div>
<p>
    In 1854, the "Great White Chief" in Washington made an offer for a large area of Indian land and promised a 'reservation' for the Indian people.  Chief Seattle's reply, here in full, has been described as the most beautiful and profound statement on the environment ever made. There is some dispute about the origins of the text, but little about the wisdom contained therein. 
</p>
<h1>Chief Seattle's Speech</h1>
<br />
<h2>THIS EARTH IS PRECIOUS</h2>
<p>
    How can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land?  The idea is
strange to us.  If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle
of the water, how can you buy them? 
</p>
<h2>ALL SACRED</h2>
<p>
    Every part of this earth is sacred to my people.  Every shining pine
needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the woods, every clearing and
humming insect is holy in the memory and experience of my people.  The sap
which courses through the trees carries the memories of the red man.  The
white man's dead forget the country of their birth when they go to walk
among the stars. Our dead never forget this beautiful earth, for it is the
mother of the red man.  We are part of the earth and it is part of us. The
perfumed flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horse, the great eagle,
these are our brothers.  The rocky crests, the juices in the meadows, the
body heat of the pony, and man - all belong to the same family. 
</p>

<h2>NOT EASY</h2>
<p>
    So, when the Great Chief in Washington send word that he wishes to buy
our land, he asks much of us.  The Great Chief sends word he will reserve
a place so that we can live comfortably to ourselves.  He will be our
father and we will be his children.  So we will consider your offer to buy
our land. But it will not be easy.  For this land is sacred to us.  This
shining water that moves in streams and rivers is not just water but the
blood of our ancestors.  If we sell you land, you must remember that it is
sacred, and you must teach your children that it is sacred and that each
ghostly reflection in the clear water of the lakes tells of events and
memories in the life of my people.  The water's murmur is the voice of my
father's father. 
</p>
<h2>KINDNESS</h2>
<p>
    The rivers are our brothers, they quench our thirst.  The rivers carry
our canoes, and feed our children.  If we sell you our land, you must
remember, and teach your children, that the rivers our brothers, and
yours, and henceforth give the rivers the kindness you would give any
brother. 
</p>
<p>
    We know that the white man does not understand our ways. One portion
of land is the same to him as the next, for he is a stranger who comes in
the night and takes from the land whatever he needs.  The earth is not his
brother, but his enemy, and when he has conquered it, he moves on.  He
leaves his father's graves behind, and he does not care.  He kidnaps the
earth from his children, and he does not care.  His father's grave, and
his children's birthright, are forgotten.  He treats his mother, the
earth, and his brother the sky, as things to be bought, plundered, sold
like sheep or bright beads.  His appetite will devour the earth and leave
behind only a desert. 
</p>
<p>
    I don't know.  Our ways are different from your ways.  The sight of
your cities pains the eyes for the red man.  But perhaps it is because the
red man is a savage and does not understand. There is no quiet place in
the white man's cities.  No place to hear the unfurling of leaves of
spring, or the rustle of an insect's wing.  But perhaps it is because I am
a savage and do not understand.  The clatter only seems to insult my ears. 
And what is there to life if a man cannot hear the lonely cry of the
whippoorwill or the arguments of the frogs around a pond at night?  I am a
red man and do not understand. 
</p>
<p>
    The Indian prefers the soft sound of the wind darting over the face of
a pond, and the smell of the wind itself, cleaned by a midday rain, or
scented with the pinon pine. 
</p>
<h2>PRECIOUS</h2>
<p>
    The air is precious to the red man, for all things share the same
breath - the beast, the tree, the man, they all share the same breath. 
The white man does not seem to notice the air he breathes.  Like a man
dying for many days, he is numb to the stench.  But if we sell you our
land, you must remember that the air is precious to us, the air shares its
spirit with all the life it supports.  The wind that gave our grandfather
his first breath also receives his last sigh.  And if we sell you our
land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where a even a white
man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow's flowers. 
</p>
<h2>ONE CONDITION</h2>
<p>
    So we will consider your offer to buy our land.  If we decide to
accept, I will make one condition: The white man must treat the beasts of
this land as his brothers. 
</p>
<p>
    I am a savage and I do not understand any other way.
</p>
<p>
    I have seen a thousand rotting buffaloes on the prairie left by the
white man who shot them from a passing train. 
</p>
<p>
    I am a savage and I do not understand how the smoking iron horse can
be more important than the buffalo that we kill only to stay alive.  What
is man without the beasts?  If all the beasts were gone, man would die
from a great loneliness of spirit.  For whatever happens to the beasts,
soon happens to man. 
</p>
<p>
    All things are connected.
</p>
<h2>THE ASHES</h2>
<p>
    You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet is the
ashes of your grandfathers.  So that they will respect the land, tell your
children that the earth is rich with the lives of our kin.  Teach your
children what we have taught our children, that the earth is our mother. 
Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth.  If men spit
upon the ground, they spit upon themselves. 
</p>
<h2>THIS WE KNOW</h2>
<p>
    The earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the earth. This we
know. 
</p>
<p>
    All things are connected like the blood which unites one family.  All
things are connected.  Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the
earth.  Man did not weave the web of life: he is merely a stand in it. 
Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.  Even the white man,
whose God walks and talks to him as friend to friend, cannot be exempt
from this common destiny.  We may be brother after all.  We shall see. 
</p>
<p>
    One thing we know, which the white man may one day discover, our God
is the same God.  You may think now that you own Him as you wish to own
our land; but you cannot.  He is the God of man; and His compassion is
equal for the red man and the white.  This earth is precious to Him, and
to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its Creator. 
</p>
<p>
    The whites too shall pass; perhaps sooner than all other tribes. 
Contaminate your bed, and you will one night suffocate in your own waste. 
But in your perishing you will shine brightly, fired by the strength of
the God who brought you to this land and for some special purpose gave you
dominion over this land and over the red man. 
</p>
<p>
    This destiny is a mystery to us, for we do not understand when the
buffalo are all slaughtered, the wild horses are tamed, the secret corners
of the forest heavy with the scent of many man, and the view of the ripe
hills blotted by talking wires.

Where is the thicket? Gone.<br />
Where is the eagle? Gone.<br />
The end of living and the beginning of survival.
