WASHINGTON (AP) _ Reversing a downward trend, the United
States
and most other nations are spending more on weapons despite a sharp
decline in Russia and Eastern Europe, a State Department study
shows.
</p><p>
The United States is by far the biggest arms exporter with
shipments more than four times greater than runner-up Britain's.
</p><p>
Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, is the leading importer of military goods,
buying more than 2{ times as many as China, ranking second.
</p><p>
On the average, the world spent $145 a person for military
forces in 1997, the most recent year covered in the study. That was
a sharp drop from the peak of $271 per person in 1987.
</p><p>
U.S. spending comprised 33 percent of the world's total in
1997,
compared to 27 percent a decade earlier. Overall, world military
spending rose to $842 billion in 1997, an increase of $32 billion,
or 2 percent, from the previous year.
``This may represent the beginning of an upturn in the world
trend following a 1995-96 low,'' the report issued Monday said.
</p><p>
Spending in developed countries rose slightly, to $610
billion,
while it climbed to a historic high of $232 billion in 1997 among
developing countries. Their share of world arms spending rose to 28
percent, up from 17 percent in 1987.
</p><p>
The world's top military spenders in 1997 were the United
States, $276 billion; China, $75 billion; Russia and France, $42
billion; Japan, $41 billion; Britain, $35 billion; and Germany, $33
billion.
</p><p>
The world's arms trade rose to $54.6 billion, up 23 percent
from
1996 but far below 1987's all-time high of $81.5 billion. These
State Department calculations are based partly on estimates of U.S.
commercial licenses, a recently adopted method that significantly
increased the American total.
Saudi Arabia was the biggest importer, with $31.3 billion.
</p><p>
China
and Taiwan, combined, were next with $12.5 billion, followed by
Japan with $6.8 billion and Egypt with $5.3 billion.
</p><p>
A separate report by the Congressional Research Service,
which
uses actual contracts, showed a steadier trend, with arms contracts
worldwide totaling $34 billion last year. This compared with $35.4
billion in 1998, $40.6 billion in 1997 and $34.8 billion in 1996.
</p><p>
Developing nations, generally among the world's poorest,
continued as the primary focus of arms merchants, accounting for
68.3 percent of all arms purchases from 1992 through 1999.
</p><p>
The United States made $25.7 billion in arms agreements with
developing countries, or more than one-third of the world total,
from 1996 through 1999. Russia was second, with $14.3 billion, and
France third at $9 billion.
