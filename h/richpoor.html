The three richest people in the world are worth more than the 43 poorest nations, a survey reveals.</p><p>
Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the top two shareholders in the giant Microsoft software corporation, and American financier Warren Buffett together have assets of $A232.5 billion.
</p><p>
Of the world's 200 richest people, 65 are American.</p><p>
The world's richest 200 have doubled their wealth in just four years to $1400 billion, according to the United Nations survey.
</p><p>
They are now worth as much as the combined wealth of the poorest 41 percent of the world's population.
</p><p>
This equates to the richest 200 having more financial assets than 2.25 billion people combined.
</p><p>
Gates, 43, saw his fortune soar from $74.5 billion to $130 billion in the past year.</p><p>
Forbes maganzine was conducting its annual review of wealth. 
</p><p>
If he maintains the growth Gates will become the first dollar trillionaire withina  decade.
</p><p>
Just 1 percent of the annual income of the super-rich 200 club - which includes the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and the Sultan of Brunei - would pay for every child on the planet to attend primary school.
</p><p>
Apart from the tiny oil-rich sultanate of Brunei, America is still the richest country in the world - with an average income of $43,500 per man, woman and child.</p><p>
It is followed by the economic powerhouse of Singapore, then Kuwait, Switzerland, Norway, Hong Kong and Japan.
