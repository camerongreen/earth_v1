The internet home of one of the people I admire.  What can be said about Noam Chomsky?  At the age of seventy years he is a supreme intellectual dissident.  Articulate, thoughtful and well researched....do yourself a favour and go to this site.  Who knows he might even rock your world as he has mine.  After that have a look at the rest of the www.zmag.org site, its one of the best.

Democracy Now is an independent media organisation in the USA.  They have one hour shows featuring interviews with some of the finest alternative thinkers in the world, as well as debates, news etc.  What is awesome for us people on the other side of the world from the USA (other than being on the other side of the world from the USA) is that they have most of their shows available for audio download.  Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, John Pilger etc...all free.  The downloads are about 27mb so you need to be patient or have a broadband connection, but well worth it.  This is the promise that the internet makes real, true alternative media in your home.

	<td>FAIR is an American media watch group that offers well-documented criticism of media bias and censorship. It seeks to invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press. It scrutinizes media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints. FAIR believes that independent, aggressive and critical media are essential to an informed democracy. But mainstream media are increasingly cozy with the economic and political powers they should be watchdogging.

The mission of our non-profit society is to transform our commercial media culture and direct it towards ecological and social awareness. Our mass media, our business culture constantly urges us to consume more and more, yet we know that our planet cannot survive this onslaught, with regards to pollution, biodiversity, resource depletion and climate change. This consumption machine, image making factory is what we want to bring to a grinding halt. We want to create a new media culture that does not have commercialism as its heart and soul.
