<h2>About</h2>
<p>
OK things are coming together with the home recording.  I've now got the guitar and bass going straight into the pc, and I'm getting the hang of the drum machine.  For anyone who has listened to my previous tracks you will hear a huge improvement in production quality.
</p>
<p>
This song was made up on the spot whilst I was trying out recording techniques, hence no lyrics.  The quotes over the top of this are from a Noam Chomsky CD I have called "Class War - The Attack on Working People".  It was pretty influential in my life, though I'm not sure how much effect it can have cut down to a 2 minute song.  
</p>
<p>
The name and main quote in the song is from a guy called Adam Smith, who is considered something of a demi god to the market worshippers running the global economy today.  He wrote a book about capitalism called Wealth of Nations which they love to quote, and they also like to selectively ignore anything he has written on morality, social justice etc.  As Chomsky points out, Adam Smith himself would have been totally against the sort of inequitable world we have today.

Anyway big thanks to Dean Bull for the lend of his bass, first time I've had access to one in many years.
