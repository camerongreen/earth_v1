<h1>If Only...</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
A guitar riff I have been playing with for a while.  Wanted to play it a little slower, but I've returned the bass now so no going back :)  As it is it turned out sounding a little more upbeat than I would have liked, so I've tried to mellow that out a little bit with the voice.
</p>
<p>
Haven't come up with a chorus for it...so I've instead overlaid a small part of a speech Martin Luther King Jnr gave called Beyond Vietnam - Time to Break the Silence.  Coincidentally I finished the song 28 years ago to the day that he made this speech, which is one of my favourites of all time.   I had to cut it up a little bit, but have tried to stay true to MLK by keeping the quotes from the same section, I hope you enjoy it.
</p>
<p>
Three guitar tracks - lead, chorus background and everything else, then the bass line, two vocal tracks, the drums and MLK.

If only you could see,<br />

<h2>Speech Extract</h2>
<p>
Most of the quotes are taken from the following extract of the speech.
</p>
<p>
"True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.
</p>
<p>
A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, "This is not just." It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of South America and say, "This is not just." The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just.
</p>
<p>
A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war, "This way of settling differences is not just." This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death." - Martin Luther King Jnr.  3 April 1967
