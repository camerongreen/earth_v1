It is pitched for the layman(me), has many thought provoking pieces, great quotes, good links, and a good navigational structure. The stuff about UFO's was a little weird though........</td></tr>

    <tr bgcolor="#8b008b"><td>Caitlin</td><td><strong>Java Guru</strong></td><td></td><td>What I think is...
        <br />I just wanted to inform you that your Java Guru is broken. I asked "Is Cameron the best thing ever?" and it said "No". I asked "Was your last answer wrong?" - it said "no". I checked "Are you completely sure?" and it said "yes". As you are clearly and obviously the best thing ever, we can deduce that your Guru is malfunctioning.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bark Mathie</td><td><strong>Stuff</strong></td><td></td><td>Hey man, wow your site has a lot more stuff on it than it used to.
        <br />
        <br />Still trying to get through that "Global Spin" book you   lent to me :)</td></tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#8b008b"><td>BG</td><td><strong>link?</strong></td><td></td><td>What I think is... Your site is rad Cameron, I think you are a pretty rare kind of person. My friend is an environmental engineer, and she would love your site I'm sure ;-)
        <br />Have you heard of the 'Choose cruelty Free' website? Animal Testing in this world today is so wrong and so unnecessary, not many people are aware that it still goes on.  Maybe you would like to check out the Preferred Products List. They have vegan products too! I never buy anything that has been tested on animals, and I try to convince as many people as possible to do the same.
        <br />It was nice meeting you at the conference, see ya round at work!
