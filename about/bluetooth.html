		I bought a Motorola v525 phone, and now wanted to figure out how to get mp3's, games etc onto it.  My setup is a little usb bluetooth dongle, and Fedora Core 1 Linux.  I found this process really easy, but apparently it wasn't for everyone so I've put up this list of what I did, it's done after the fact so if I forgot a step forgive me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Plug in the bluetooth dongle, power up your phone.
	</p>
	<p>
	Then the packages....most of these have other dependencies, follow them all, I didn't cut any corners.
	<ol>
		<li>bluez-utils</li>
		<li>bluez-libs</li>
		<li>bluez-sdp</li>
		<li>gnome-bluetooth</li>
		<li>openobex</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		OK next we need to tell the phone that we want to connect via bluetooth.  Go into 'Settings' -> 'Connection' -> 'Bluetooth Link' -> 'Setup'
	</p>
	<p>
		First set 'Power' to on, then select 'Find Me', it will tell you that the phone can be found for 60 seconds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Back to the PC.  The first time you go through this process you will be prompted to put in numbers for the phone and pc to identify/authorise each other.  This only happens once.
	</p>
	<p>
		These are the commands I use to put stuff on it...
		<ol>
			<li>service bluetooth start</li>
			<li>hciconfig hci0 up</li>
			<li>hcitool scan - this will give you the BD address of the phone (in MAC address format), copy that into another document</li>
			<li>gnome-obex-send --dest 00:0B:28:DE:22:53 file.mp3 - where dest is the BD address and file is the mp3 you want to put on the phone</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		The phone should ask you if you want to accept a file transfer...select yes!  The phone seems to know about different file types, if it is a .jar game file it will ask you if you want to install it, if it is an mp3 it will ask you if you want to make it a ring tone.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also use Nautilus, type 'nautilus &' on the command line, do the hciconfig step, then type in 'bluetooth://' into the Nautilus address bar, you should see the phone.
	</p>
	<p>
		To get photos etc off the phone, set up the bluetooth link as described above, this time using the obex server :
	</p>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>service bluetooth start</li>
			<li>hciconfig hci0 up</li>
			<li>hcitool scan - this will give you the BD address of the phone (in MAC address format), copy that into another document</li>
			<li>gnome-obex-server &</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Then go to a photo, click on the menu button, then you will get 'move' or 'copy' options, after selecting one of these, the photo will turn up in the root users home directory.
	</p>
	<p>
	I'm still new to this process, I haven't got the calendar syncing with anything, I haven't put any weird file types on the phone (to use it for file storage like a bluetooth enabled usb key) and yesterday I downloaded a photo off the phone that I wanted to put back on but was unable to.  Will put answers to these up if and when I get them.
