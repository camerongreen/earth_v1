<p>Like many people, music is a deep part of me.  I've played guitar for many years, and finally decided to put some tracks down when I wanted to know what The Lotus In Samsara sounded like, because I couldn't play the guitar and sing it at the same time.</p>
<p>This is hard core budget recording. I already had a guitar, amp etc, I've used all free Open Source sound programmes like Audacity, SWH and CMT ladspa libraries, libJack and the Hydrogen drum machine and I got a headset with a microphone on it for free from a conference.  My only outlay thus far has been a few dollars for a plug convertor to have my amp go into my pc.</p>
<p>I've really enjoyed doing them, although thinking of other people listening to them has a bit of cringe factor about it, I put them up because my webpage would be incomplete without my music, because it is a large part of who I am.</p>
<p>If you have a reasonable speed connection, most of the songs will take a few minutes to download, depending on how big they are (which is listed after each song).</p>
<p>They are ordered by heaviness so if you want something mellow try the last song....</p>
