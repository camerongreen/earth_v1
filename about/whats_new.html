	<h1>What's New</h1>
<p>I am always tinkering with my page, so there is usually something new to see though you might have to search for it.  I will endeavour to put up my latest changes here so people who have been here before can know which things have been added or changed recently.</p>
<h2>Celebration Nut Roast</h2>
<p>I made this for Christmas day and a few people have asked for the recipe so I've put it up.</p>
<h2>London's Best Vegan Restaurants</h2>
<p>On the Animal Liberation page you will find a list of London's best vegan restaurants as voted by me!  EReally this place is a paradise for vegans and vegetarians, I wish I could take them all home with me to Australia when I return (whenever that will be).</p>
<h2>Love</h2>
<p>A bit strange to write about but on my Transcendence page you will find a treatise on Love...see what being single for four years can do to you :)</p>
<h2>Suggest Something</h2>
<p>If you have any suggestions for new things, please send them to me!</p>
