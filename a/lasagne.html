	<h1>Lasagne</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="intro">
	Who doesn't like lasagne?  This one is very similar to the meat based ones I grew up eating, so it is very non veg*n friendly.  It's also relatively easy, and makes enough for 6 servings which can be frozen for future meals.  You will need a baking tray to put the lasagne in, and a large pot to cook the sauce</p>
<br />
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ol class="listBox">
<li>600g Butter Nut Pumpkin Chopped</li>
<li>1 Box Large Instant Cooking Lasagne Sheets (Prepare by placing in warm water in baking tray)</li>
<li>2 Cans Chopped Roma Tomatoes</li>
<li>1 can (375g) tomato paste</li>
<li>1/3 Cup Textured Vegetable Protein or TVP (Prepare by placing in small bowl with warm water)</li>
<li>2 Handfuls of Mushrooms, Chopped (Not too finely)</li>
<li>1 large Carrot, halved and sliced</li>
<li>1 Capsicum Diced</li>
<li>1 Brown Onion Diced</li>
<li>2 Cloves Crushed Garlic</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons Mixed Herbs (Italian Mix is good, basil, oregano etc)</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons Olive Oil (Or oil left over from sundried tomato jar is best)</li>
<li>Optional (See recipe) 1/2 Cup plain flour</li>
<li>Optional (See recipe) 1/2 Cup Soy Milk</li>
</ol>
<br />
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol class="listBox">
<li>Place pumpkin in a hot steamer, or in boiling water</li>
<li>Put 1 1/2 Tablespoons of oil in large pan, then onions</li>
<li>Stir for a moment, then add in Capsicum and garlic.  Cook till onion and capsicum slightly soft</li>
<li>Add mushrooms and tvp, stir through till hot</li>
<li>Add the carrots and stir through till hot</li>
<li>Add cans of tomatoes and stir through</li>
<li>Once Pumpkin is slightly soft, drain if necessary and add</li>
<li>Add tomatoe paste and herbs, stirring in to mash some of the pumpkin and allow to cook for 5 minutes.  Make sure mixture doesn't dry, and add 1/3 cup water if needed</li>
<li>Once sauce is prepared, place a thin later of it on the base of the Lasagne Pan.  Place a layer of lasagne sheets on this, then another tickers layer of pasta etc, until you have used up both, making sure you also have a layer of sauce on top.  (Try to get an idea of how many layers of pasta you will have by the number of sheets you have in the bottom row)</li>
<li>Now for the sauce to put on top.  You can just 1 Cup of vegan cheese on top, or you could make a white sauce which is more fun.  White Sauce - In the pan on a low heat, place last 1/2 Tablespoon of oil, then the flour.  Slowly stir in the soy milk, crushing any lumps that appear with your trusty wooden spoon.  If you have any vegan cheese a small amount, say 1/2 Cup, will make the sauce even better.  Once ingredients are combined nicely and there are no lumps in it, pour on top of Lasagne.</li>
<li>Put Sauce on top of Lasagne, and then place in over on 350 Degrees for 20 Minutes (or 30 Minutes if you like overcooked Lasagne like some crazy people).</li>
</ol>

<br />
</ol>

		<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>You can use Eggplant instead of Pumpkin, and it is just as good.  Dice eggplant finely, and put in just before onion.</p>
