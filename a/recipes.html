<h1>Vegan Recipes</h1>
<p>
Anyone can make something taste compelling, by adding enough salt, sugar, fats, flavour enhancer 621 etc, as our fast food chains are evidence of.  MacDonalds, in defending advertising their products as "nutritious", said that their food contained nutrients, so theoretically it could be called nutritious.   Of course it doesn't matter that any average person thinks nutritious means "is healthy", they can play with words, create false associations in our mind, and sell us more of their artificial junk.
</p>
<p>
 The fast food chains, snack makers and processed food purveyors have made incredible profits from the fact that we have lost our way with food.  Many of our most prevalent and dangerous diseases are linked to eating poor quality food.  Many mental and behavioural problems are also linked to poor diet.  To turn this around I think the first step is for us to start cooking more ourselves.  We need to remember it can be one of the great pleasures in life, a central part of who we want to be, a high point in ones day and if it is healthy can bring great rewards in our mental and physical well being. 
</p>
<p>
Spend more time cooking, enjoy making healthy food, savour it, share it with the people around you.  A step in reconnecting with the world and yourself is through enjoying one of lifes wholesome pleasures, food that provides the best possible fuel for our body.
