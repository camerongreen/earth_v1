		I am the organiser of the London Vegan Meetup.  If you would like to come along and meet some vegans then all are welcome.  You don't have to be vegan, just interested in having a vegan meal and knowing more about the vegan lifestyle.  We meet usually on a Saturday for lunch each month and the people attending couldn't be more lovely.  Click on the link above to sign up and find out where/when our next outing is.

		</td>
		<td class="small">
		The only annoying thing about being a vegan or vegetarian (veg*n is shorthand for both) is that you constantly have to rebuff urban legends about lack of protein etc.  The American Dietetic Association is one of the most eminent dietary associations in the world.  Before you criticise diets free from animal products, you should read the science behind it.  Rather than relying on heresay, conformity and animal exploitative industry advertising.

One of the most active animal rights organizations in the world. PETA have been instrumental in a number of campaigns notably the anti-fur campaign.  PETA is very well known in America and has for better or worse (they have some people who say some pretty stupid things) become a standard bearer for the US movement.

		Living in a country were the timber lords are allowed to function unchecked, the orangutan is facing extinction.  Orangutans are thoughtful, intelligent and amazing creatures.  Their name is derived from the native words literally meaning "Man of the forest", as humans we need such a creature to stare back into our eyes and remind us of what really is sacred in life.

Most people are shocked to learn that there are only a few thousand of even the most numerous species alive today.  The loss of habitat through the ever expanding land needs of people, and hunting for bizarre Asian medicines, have pushed this noble animal to the verge of extinction in the wild.
