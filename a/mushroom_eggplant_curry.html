<p class="pageHeading">Mushroom and Eggplant/Aubergine Curry</p>
<p class="subHeading">Introduction</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a recipe its very hard to get wrong, if you can add gravy powder to water, you can make this dish as the rest is just adding ingredients and heating them up.  Everytime I make it, people have enjoyed it and asked me how I made it, so I've put the recipe here.  The beauty of it is that it is flexible, I've never measured the ingredients but have guessed here to be helpful.  After you make it the first time, you can add more eggplant, change the peas to beans, more mushrooms (I did), more gravy, its up to you.  The main trick is the brown gravy for the sauce, it gives it a lovely texture and look, and really makes the dish appetising and hard to get wrong.  This will make a lot, probably enough for six people, though I live on my own so I freeze it in containers and have a weeks dinners all ready : )

<p class="subHeading">Tips</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I like a curry to be nice and moist so I can scoop it up with bread, hence the two cans of tomatoes and the 2 cups of water.  We want the mixture to have a decent amount of moisture when we put the red lentils in.  This is what the water is for, we add that to the mixture so that there is enough liquid for the lentils to soak and cook in.  Whilst we aren't making a thick soup it's not too far off that (but no so much that its runny of course).  Whilst its cooking, keep checking that the lentils are in enough moisture to cook, if it looks a little thick and dry, add more water.  Its OK if its a little runny whilst the lentils are cooking, because when you add the gravy powder it is going to thicken a bit.
