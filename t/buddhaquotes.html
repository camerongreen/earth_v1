<p>
To speak no ill, to do no harm, to practice restraint according to the fundamental precepts, to be moderate in eating, to live in seclusion, to devote oneself to higher consciousness, this is the teaching of the Buddhas.
</p><p>
Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world; it is appeased by love. This is an eternal Law.
</p><p>
By endeavour, diligence, discipline, and self-mastery, let the wise man make (of himself) an island that no flood can overwhelm.
</p><p>
This fickle, unsteady mind, difficult to guard, difficult to control, the wise man makes straight, as the fletcher the arrow.
</p><p>
Whatever harm a foe may do to a foe, or a hater to another hater, a wrongly-directed mind may do one harm far exceeding these.
</p><p>
One should not pry into the faults of others, into things done and left undone by others. One should rather consider what by oneself is done and left undone.
</p><p>
As a beautiful flower that is full of hue but lacks fragrance, even so fruitless is the well-spoken word of one who does not practice it.
</p><p>
If, as one fares, one does not find a companion who is better or equal, let one resolutely pursue the solitary course; there can be no fellowship with the fool.
</p><p>
Even if all his life a fool associates with a wise man, he will not understand the Truth, even as the spoon the flavour of the soup.
</p><p>
Even as a solid rock is unshaken by the wind, so are the wise unshaken by praise or blame.
</p><p>
Few among men are that who cross to the further shore. the others merely run up and down on the bank on this side.
</p><p>
He whose senses are mastered like horses well under the charioteer's control, he who is purged of pride, free from passions, such a steadfast one even the gods envy.
</p><p>
One may conquer in battle a thousand times a thousand men, yet he is the best of conquerors who conquers himself. 
</p><p>
Though one may live a hundred years with no true insight and self-control, yet better, indeed, is a life of one day for a man who meditates in wisdom.
</p><p>
It is well with the evil-doer until his evil ripens. But when his evil deed bears fruit, he then sees his ill efforts.
</p><p>
Do not think lightly of evil, saying:'It will not come to me'. Even a water pot is filled by the falling of drops.  Likewise the fool, gathering it drop by drop, fills himself with evil.
</p><p>
Do not think lightly of good, saying:'It will not come to me.' Even as a water pot is filled with the falling of drops, so the wise man, gathering it drop by drop, fills himself with good.
</p><p>
All tremble at weapons; all fear death. Comparing others with oneself, one should not slay, nor cause to slay.
</p><p>
He who, seeking his own happiness, torments with the rod creatures that are desirous of happiness, shall not obtain happiness hereafter.
</p><p>
The man of little learning grows like a bull; his flesh grows but not his wisdom. 
</p><p>
Oneself is one's own protector (refuge); what other protector (refuge) can there be? With oneself fully controlled, one obtains a protection that is hard to gain.
</p><p>
By oneself indeed is evil done and by oneself is one defiled. By oneself is evil left undone and by oneself indeed is one purified. Purity and impurity depend on oneself. No one can purify another.
</p><p>
Come, behold this world, how it resembles an ornamented royal chariot, in which floods flounder, but for the wise there is no attachment to it.
</p><p>
Do not do any evil, to cultivate good, to purify one's mind, this is the teaching of the Buddhas. 
</p><p>
The most excellent ascetic practice is patience and forbearance.
</p><p>
Happy indeed we live with hate among the hateful, We live free from hatred amongst hateful men.
</p><p>
Health is the best gain; contentment is the best wealth.
</p><p>
He who holds back arisen anger as one checks a whirling chariot, him I call a charioteer; other folk only hold the reins.
</p><p>
Conquer anger by love, evil by good; conquer the miser with liberality, and the liar with truth. 
</p><p>
Be on your guard against mental agitation; be controlled in thoughts. Forsaking evil thoughts, follow right ways in thoughts.
</p><p>
The wise are controlled in deeds, controlled in words, controlled in thoughts, verily, they are fully controlled.
</p><p>
By degrees, little by little, from moment to moment, a wise man removes his own impurities, as the smith removes the dross off silver.
</p><p>
All mental states have mind as their forerunner, mind is their chief, and they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts, with a defiled mind, then suffering follows one even as the wheel follows the foot of the draught-ox.
</p><p>
As rust, arisen out of iron, eats itself away, even so his own deed lead the transgressor to the states of woe.
</p><p>
The fault of others is easily seen; but one's own is hard to see. Like chaff one winnows other's faults; but one's own one conceals as a crafty fowler disguises himself.
</p><p>
He who understands both sides in this world is called a sage.
