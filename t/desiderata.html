<h1>Desiderata</h1>
<h2>by Max Ehrmann</h2>
<p>
Go placidly amid the noise and haste and remember what peace there may be in silence.
</p>
<p>
As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.
</p>
<p>
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
</p>
<p>
Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.
</p>
<p>
If you compare yourself with others you may become vain and bitter; for  always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
</p>
<p>
Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
 it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
</p>
<p>
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
 for the world is full of trickery.
</p>
<p>
But let that not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.
</p>
<p>
Be yourself.
</p>
<p>
Especially do not feign affection.
</p>
<p>
Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.
</p>
<p>
Take kindly the council of years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
</p>
<p>
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
</p>
<p>
But do not distress yourself with imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
</p>
<p>
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.
</p>
<p>
You are child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
</p>
<p>
And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
</p>
<p>
Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.  And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.
</p>
<p>
With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.
</p>
<p>
Be cheerful.
</p>
<p>
Strive to be happy.
